    Shell Operation
 
    1- Reads its input from a file, from a string supplied as an argument to the -c invocation option, or from the user’s terminal.
    2- Breaks the input into words and operators, obeying the quoting rules described in Quoting. These tokens are separated by metacharacters. Alias expansion is performed by this step.
    3- Parses the tokens into simple and compound commands.
    4- Performs the various shell expansions, breaking the expanded tokens into lists of filenames and commands and arguments.
    5- Performs any necessary redirections and removes the redirection operators and their operands from the argument list.
    6- Executes the command.
    7- Optionally waits for the command to complete and collects its exit status. 

    A metacharacter is a space, tab, newline, or one of the following characters: ‘|’, ‘&’, ‘;’, ‘(’, ‘)’, ‘<’, or ‘>'.
